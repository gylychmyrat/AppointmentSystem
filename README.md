# Getting Started with the App

In this project, user can login as a Provider OR a Client.
In the case of Provider, they can set their schedule for clients.
Then User can use the schedule set by Provider to make an appointment.

You can find userNames,passwords and roles as well as provider schedules in providers.js file in the assets/data.
Currently, App only uses that schedules and we can add many by hardcoding as we dont have any api yet.
So, clients can only choose those dates in the providers.js
